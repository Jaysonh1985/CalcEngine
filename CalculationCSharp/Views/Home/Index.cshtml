            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                We are the people who will spend 2 hours doing a 20 min piece of work so that the next time it takes 10 mins.
                <br />
                <br />
                In any organisation this needs to be scored so that the 2 hours spent will be recouped - i.e. the 10 mins saved will eventually outweigh the 2 hours spent.

            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>
                What we do is find opportunities where an imbalance exists.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our first opportunity we have discovered is Pension Administration and initially - Calculations.
                <br />
                <br />
                In pensions we believe automation of calculations has an imbalance which is also compounded by the fact that most organisations look at automation in terms of calculations not events.

            <h2>Why we do it</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that a lot of work carried out in a typical work day is repeatable.
                <br />
                <br />
                The challenge of carrying out repeatable work is ensuring that the work is repeated in the same manner. When work is repeatable it can be automated.
                <br />
                <br />
                Automation gives efficiency and reduces risk.
